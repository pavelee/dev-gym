## Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?) 

Fascinated by AI's transformative power in programmer education. 

Looking for a positive future with AI.

### How I built it (How did you utilize refine? Did you learn something new along the way? Pick up a new skill?) 

- Tech stack: Next.js, Antd UI, Supabase
- Using Refine built-in integration with Supabase. Really cool!
   - instant integration! wow!
   - Utilizing Refine's hooks for data fetching. In my opinion it's the best part of the framework.
- Admin panel built with generated code
   - Firstly I was a little bit confused, but after tutorial it become clear.
   - it really speed up CRUD job
   - I love idea to copy and adjust code, a lot of flexibility 
- OpenAI integration for AI hints
